						  A Mexican project that opens a communication portal between an indigenous community and the rest of the world. The Wixarikas
						  erroneously known as Huicholes are part of a Mexican town. Globally known for their art: The Huichol art.<br/> <br/>

						  Do you know that every piece of art they create really tells a story? each bracelet, each table, each figure tells something 
						  about their culture. Those stories create an identity for them. Through their tales, which have passed from generation to 
						  generation, they create a heritage to encourage new generations to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.<br/> <br/>

						  Apart from facing the possible disapperence of their sacred land due mining, day by day they face a problem that goes unnoticed:
						  'migration'. Being located in the highest part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, communication and access to new technologies is 
						  almost impossible. This force the new generations to migrate to the big cities, confronting the language problem that threatens 
						  the extinction of their native language.<br/> <br/>

						  The Mariya project tries to demonstrate that the technology is not fought with the ancestral customs of a town, giving the floor
						  to those who deserve to be heard, seeking to rescue their stories and knowledge which they consider sacred.<br/> <br/>

						  Fall in love with the Wixarika culture with the documentary: <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='https://huicholesfilm.com/en/'>
						  Huicholes the last peyote guardians</a>.

    <h3>Mariya</h3>
    <h4>Taking advantage of technology and all available resources, we intend to put an end to the communication barrier between the Wixarica (Huicholes) community and the rest of the world, seeking to rescue their stories and knowledge which they consider sacred. Mariya is a translation device that seeks to save a Mexican culture.</h4>

    <h3>Bike Share</h3>
    <h4>Imagine yourself owning of a bike sharing company like CycleHop and you want to predict how many bikes you need because if you have too few you're losing money from potential riders or vice versa if you have too many you're wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. This project predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day from historical data, so you can know how many bikes you will need in the near future.</h4>

    <h4>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 360 millon people worldwide have disabling hearing loss of which 70 million people use sign language as their first language. Now, how many interpreters are there? much less than half. In this project I built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL).</h4>

    <h3>TV Scripts Generator</h3>
    <h4>The way to write a script for a TV show is to actually write a script. A pen is useful, typing is also good. Keep putting words on the page, but if for some reason you don't feel good, you're sick or you just feel stuck, try to use a computer that writes it for you. This project generates an original piece of writing after being trained using your existing scripts, therefore, the new piece will conserve your own writing style.</h4>

    <h3>The Isolation Game</h3>
    <h4>Isolation is a two-player game in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, the cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. In this version each player is restricted to L-shaped movements on a 7x7 board. This project is a game-playing agent to win the isolation game.</h4>

    <h4>Vision is the main way humans gain information about the world, with the passage of time we have been able to give eyes to the machines, from that, amazing applications have been created. For example, a company called Orbital Insigths analyze satellite imagery to count cars and oil tank levels automatically to predict such things as mall sales and oil production. In this project I developed a program capable of recognize and classify ten different types of images.</h4>

We've accomplish a lot in the world where 13 of the most common languages are natively spoken by less than 50 percent of the population. What would the world be like if we could all work together without a language barrier?. This project is an English to French translator.</h4>
