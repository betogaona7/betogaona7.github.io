Vision is the main way humans gain information about world. I see a cup of tea, I pick up the cup of tea. Ever since humans 
started imagining machines moving around, and  iteracting with the world we've given them eyes 
In this project I build a Convulutional Network with Tensorflow and it recognnize objects and images, we train it using the 
the CIFAR-10 Dataset which consist of 60,000  images of ten different objects.

Today, we want automated cars to be able to distinguish between people, and trees, and the road. We're enabling our cars to do
this using Convolutional netrowks
