# Imagine yourself owning a bike sharing company like Cycle hop. You want to predict how many bikes you need because
# if you have too few you're losing money from potenitial riders. If you have too many you're wasting money on bikes that 
# are just sitting around.   So you want to predict from historial data how many bikes you'll need in the near future. 
# A good way to do this is with a neural network 
# Finally you'll compare your networks predictions with actual data 
# predict the number of bikeshare users on a givenday
