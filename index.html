  A Mexican project that opens a communication portal between an indigenous community and the rest of the world. 
  The Wixarikas erroneously known as Huicholes are part of a Mexican town. Globally known for their art: The 
  Huichol art.<br/> <br/>

  Do you know that every piece of art they create really tells a story? each bracelet, each table, each figure 
  tells something about their culture. Those stories create an identity for them. Through their tales, which have passed from 
  generation to generation, they create a heritage to encourage new generations to follow in the footsteps of their 
  ancestors.<br/> <br/>

  Apart from facing the possible disappearance of their sacred land due to mining, day by day they face a problem that goes 
  unnoticed: 'migration'. Being located in the highest part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, communication and access to 
  new technologies is almost impossible. This force the new generations to migrate to the big cities, confronting the 
  language problem that threatens the extinction of their native language.<br/> <br/>

  The Mariya project tries to demonstrate that the technology is not fought with the ancestral customs of a town, giving 
  the floor to those who deserve to be heard, seeking to rescue their stories and knowledge which they consider sacred.
  <br/> <br/>

  Fall in love with the Wixarika culture with the documentary:

project-name="Bike Share" 
technical-description="
  Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process of membership, rental and 
  return back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position 
  and return back to another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which are 
  composed of over 500 thousands bicycles.<br/><br/>

  This project is a simple Multi-Layer Neural Network to make predictions of bike-sharing usage. Using a 
  <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset'>dataset</a> that has 
  the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The data is pretty complicated. 
  The weekends have lower overall ridership and there are spikes when people are biking to and from work during the week. 
  Also have information about temperature, humidity, and wind speed. all of this likely affect the number of riders. <br/>
  <br/>

  The network has two layers, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer uses the sigmoid function for activations.
  The output layer has only one node and is used for regression, the output node is the same as the input node.<br/><br/>
  In the following graph we can compare our predictions with the actual data:<br/><br/>

project-name="Sign Language Recognizer" 
technical-description="
  The overall goal of this project was to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating
  the power of probabilistic models. In particular, this project employs Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)  that use a 
  preprocessed 
  <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/%7Edreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php'>
  dataset</a> of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from the video to identify individual words from test sequences.<br/><br/>

  The next video is an example of how the hand locations are tracked:<br/><br/></p>

  </div><br/><br/><p>

  I experimented with four feature sets and three model selection methods (that is 12 possible combinations). The best 
  combination was features-ground (those are differences between hand and nose locations) with Selector CV (Log likelihood 
  with Cross-validation folds) that gets a Word Error Rate (WER) of 53%. This can be improved by adding techniques like 
  Context training, Statistical Grammar, State typing, Segmentally Boosted HMMs and probably many more that will help us 
  obtain even lower WER.<br/><br/>

project-name="Air Cargo Planner" 
technical-description="
  In this project, I defined a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) that use a 
  planning search agent to solve deterministic logistics problems for an Air Cargo transport system. For example the next 
  problem:</br></br></p>

  <div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img src='./img/planner-problem.png' alt='Planner problem' class='planner-img'>
  </div><br/><br/><p>

  Then set up the problems for the search of two types: Non-heuristic searches and Heuristic searches. The non-heuristic searches
  include Breadth-First search (BFS), Depth-First graph search (DFS) and Uniform-Cost search (UCS). Of them, the most
  efficient was the UCS algorithm.</br></br>

  For the heuristic searches, I used the A star algorithm (A*) with two different heuristics:</br></p>
  <ul type='disk'>
    <li>
      <p>Ignore preconditions heuristic - The minimum number of actions that must be carried out from the current state 
      in order to satisfy all of the goal conditions by ignoring the preconditions required for an action to be executed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Level sum heuristic - The sum of level costs of the individual goals (admissible if goals independent).</p>
    </li>
  </ul></br><p>
  A* with ignore preconditions heuristic was the one that works best. The following image is the answer to the problem
  posed in the previous image solved by both algorithms (A* and UCS):<br/><br/></p>

  <div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img class='planner' src='./img/planner-solution.png' alt='Planner solution'>

  UCS takes 157 seconds to solve it while A* only takes 30 seconds. That is one of the great advantages of using heuristics.<br/><br/>

  This project generates Simpsons TV scripts. Specifically for a scene in the Moes tavern, using a Recurrent Neural

project-name="New Faces Generator" 
technical-description="
  This is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that use the 
  <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html'>CelebFaces Attributes dataset 
  (CelebA)</a> consisting of more than 200,000 of celebrity images with annotations as training to generate new images of 
  faces.<br/><br/>

  GANs are used for generating realistic data. The word adversarial in Generative Adversarial Networks means that we have 
  two networks, the generator and the discriminator which are in a competition with each other. The generator wants to 
  minimize the value function and the discriminator wants to maximize the value function.<br/><br/> 

  We can think of this process as being like a competition between counterfeiters and police. The generator net is like a 
  group of counterfeiters trying to produce fake money and pass it off as real. The police try to catch counterfeiters 
  using fake money but still want to let everyone else spend their real money. Over time the police get better at detecting 
  counterfeit money and the counterfeiters get better at faking it. Eventually, the counterfeiters are forced to make perfect 
  replicas of real money.<br/><br/>

  When we train a GAN on the CelebA dataset we can watch it being generating random images, gradually learn to generate 
  faces. That is the basic idea of how GANs work.<br/><br/>

  In the project, CelebA images were cropped to remove parts of the image that do not include a face, then resized down 
  to 28x28 pixels. The following image is an example of how the generated faces look.<br/><br/></p>

project-name="The Isolation Game" 
technical-description="
  Game playing has long been one of the cornerstones of AI advancements. One of the biggest advancements in recent AI has 
  been in this field through Googles Go winning AlphaGo AI. Similarly, one of the seminal events of the 20th century was 
  seeing IBMs Deep Blue defeated Gary Kasparov, a world chess champion in a game of chess.<br/><br/>

  In this project, I designed and implemented a game-playing agent to play a game using adversarial search. The agent play 
  Isolation. A two-player game in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on the 
  board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player 
  with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared winner. Each player is restricted to L-shaped movements 
  (like a knight in chess) on a 7 by 7 board, however, the player can jump blocked or occupied spaces (just like knight in 
  chess).<br/><br/>

  The goal was to program a player that beats its opponent consistently at this game. Additionally, the agent has a fixed 
  time limit each turn to search for the best move and respond. If the time limit expires during a players turn, that player 
  forfeits the match, and the opponent wins.<br/><br/>
  I used three different heuristics to perform the adversarial search and compare their performance:<br/>

  <ul type='disk'>
    <li>
      <p>The basic heuristic - Evaluate how good is the board for the player and how good it is for the opponent, then 
      subtract the opponents score from the players. This heuristics would penalize our computer player with more potential 
      moves which are counterproductive, It continues to take into account boards where the current player can make a larger 
      number of moves and also penalizes boards where the opponent can make a larger number of moves.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The lucky heuristic - This heuristic take into account the number of locations that are still available on the 
      board, however this number does not reflect the goodness of the board but confirm the next statement: Both the number 
      of open spaces and the number of moves made are the same for every position for the same depth, thus any heuristic 
      that relies only on these two exactly as effective (minus very slight performance penalty) as a zero score function.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The coward heuristic - It is called coward because the goal is to get as far away from the opponent as possible, here 
      is the otherwise of the basic heuristic evaluation function.</p>
    </li>
  </ul><br/><br/><p>

  In conclusion, the best was the basic heuristic because it obtains a better win rate, it is no computationally complex and 
  it evaluates very well how the current board configuration is for our player.<br/><br/></p>

project-name="The Sudoku Puzzle" 
technical-description="
  This project can solve any Sudoku puzzle, also have some extensions. The first extension is an implementation of the 
  naked twins technique. The second is a modification to solve diagonal sudokus. <br/><br/>

  The naked twins technique is the following. Consider the following puzzle, and look the two highlighted boxes, F3 
  and I3.<br/><br/></p>

  <div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img class='sudoku-img' src='./img/naked-twins.png' alt='Naiked twins 1'>
  </div><br/><br/><p>

  As we can see, both belong to the same column, and both permit the values 2 and 3. Now, we do not know which one has 
  a 2 and which one has a 3, but we know one thing for sure - the values 2 and 3 are locked in those two boxes, so no 
  other box in their same unit (the third column) can contain the values 2 or 3.<br/><br/> Thus, we go over all the 
  boxes in the same unit, and remove the values 2 and 3 from their possible values.<br/><br/></p>

  <div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img class='sudoku-img' src='./img/naked-twins-2.png' alt='Naiked twins 2'>
  </div><br/><br/><p>

  As you can see, we've removed the values 2 and 3 from the boxes D3 and E3. This is naked twins technique. A diagonal 
  sudoku is like a regular sudoku, except that among the two main diagonals, the number 1 to 9 should all appear exactly 
  once. The next video is an example where the agent solves a diagonal sudoku.<br/><br/></p>

  Since humans started imagining machines moving around and interacting with the world, we have given them eyes. Look at

  Odyssey. He is just one big eye.<br/><br/>

  Today, we want automated cars to be able to distinguish between people, and trees, and the road. We are enabling our 
  cars to do this using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).<br/><br/>

  Starting with the work of Yann LeCun in the late 90s, convolutional networks, typically shortened to cognets, gained 
  popularity for detecting and recognizing handwritten characters and images. In 2012 a huge dataset called ImageNet 
  was released with 1,000 labeled categories and over a million training images. Alex Krizhevskys AlexNet, used a deep 
  convolutional network trained on GPUs to achieve a 15% error rate on ImageNet, and this is easily beat the second best
  attempt that had 26% errors.<br/><br/>

  In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow and it recognizes objects and images. Here I used 
  the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html'>CIFAR-10 dataset</a> which

project-name="Machine Translation" 
technical-description="
  Take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. In this project, I taught a sequence-to-sequence 
  (seq2seq) model how to translate from one language to another training it on a dataset of English to French sentences.
  <br/><br/>

  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a powerful class of neural networks that deal with sequential data. They are
  especially suited for language and translation tasks because they can extend to sequences of any length. But more 
  importantly, they share their parameters across different timesteps. So when they do learn a language model, they do it 
  a lot more efficiently than a traditional feedforward network would.<br/><br/>

  The challenge with neural networks is to find the right dataset to feed your model and guide it through the learning 
  process.<br/><br/>

  The seq2seq model can do amazing things. If you have a dataset with questions and answers you can make a 
  Question-Answering model, or if you have a dataset with new articles and their summaries you can make a summarization bot, 
  or like in this project, if you have a dataset with English phrases and French phrases you can make an English to French 
  translator.<br/><br/></p>

    Since the dataset I used only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of thousands that you use, you are going to see 
    good results using these words. If you want to create a better translation model, you will need better data. You can train 
    on the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener' href='http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/'>WMT10 French-English corpus dataset</a>. 
    This dataset has more vocabulary and richer in topics discussed, however, this will take you days to train, so make sure 
    you have a GPU and the neural network is performing well on this dataset. <br/><br/>

    <h3>Machine Translation</h3>
    <h4>Language is the backbone of our civilization. Without written records of previous scientific discoveries, we could never accomplish great events like traveling to space. We've accomplished a lot in the world where 13 of the most common languages are natively spoken by less than 50 percent of the population. What would the world be like if we could all work together without a language barrier?. This project is an English to French translator.</h4>
